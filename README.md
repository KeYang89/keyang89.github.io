```Issue:	When clicking the link to upload a file, nothing happens when I try to upload a CSV or JSON file. Only Excel files work. I have not tried TSV or DSV files, but I’m assuming those will have problems as well, if CSV files are not recognized properly.```

```Issue:	When pasting JSON data, it doesn’t seem to parse properly. Is there a certain structure the JSON file has to have?```

- []. Browser:	_Internet Explorer_

```Issue:	Within the ‘Try samples and learn’ section, there is very inconsistent behavior with the drag and drop boxes (where it says ‘Map your Dimensions’). There are some sections I cannot drag. Other sections I can drag at first, but then after I delete it, I can’t drag it anymore.```
